                <h2>Instructor Preparation</h2>
                <p>This week is all about asynchronous JavaScript. There will be countless opportunities and use cases for asynchronous requests and functionality in web applications. The goal this week is to have our students understand well how this process works. They have worked with promises, callbacks, and asynchronous functions in Node quite a bit this semester. This week will focus on how to bring that understanding and those concepts to the frontend. </p>

                <h3>Class Activity</h3>
                <p>To help students gain more experience working with async requests to update the DOM, here is a class activity. The following zip file can be distributed to your students. It has tasks in it instructing them regarding what they should do. This can be done in a class setting as a group, in teams, or individually. </p>
