                <h2>Instructor Preparation</h2>
                <p>This is going to be a very important week for the class. Students will have an opportunity to get to know one another in a channel that you create in Teams. Students will also have to download software that they'll need throughout the semester, get started in the Academind course, and do their first assignments. It is important that students understand that the first few weeks of this course will be very busy as they learn Node.js and go through the Academind course. This will prepare them for the remainder of the semester where the remainder of the grade will be accounted for. </p>
                <p>Regarding their grades, it is important for them to know how they will be graded, and how much weight each assignment carries in the course. Please share the syllabus with them, and point out the extremely large portion of the grade the final project will account for. </p>
                <p>Explain the way the course will work. They will be working in groups through the whole semester. Those groups need to be formed this week. In the first six weeks, they will have team assignments that are independent from one another. Starting in week 7, they will be put in new teams for their final projects. These teams will create an application together and each weekly team activity will simply serve as a way to be accountable, but their primary grade will be derived from their final submission. Some sections of CSE 341 will work with WDD 330 students for the final project. Others will not. Both of these <a href="https://byui-cse.github.io/cse341-course/projectStuff/prj2/" target="_blank">project descriptions</a> are in <a href="https://byui-cse.github.io/cse341-course" target="_blank">the course</a>.</p>
                <p>Help the students understand the importance of not falling behind. There will be several hours of videos to watch/engage in each week at the start of the semester, and for them to finish their first full stack application by week 6, it is crucial that they do not fall behind.</p>
