        <h1>Project 2 High-level Tasks</h1>
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>Your personal assignments of the second half of the semester are very flexible in how you implement them. You will only be graded on your final project submission.</p>
        <p>To avoid falling behind, and to ensure successful and timely delivery of your project, it is recommended that you consider how you will spread out the six week's worth of work.</p>

You have the flexibility to create your application in the way that you prefer. The following are tasks in any application that will need to take place. You may choose to implement one per week depending on your preference.</p>
