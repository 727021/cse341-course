        <h1>Project 1 Requirements</h1>
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>For the first half of the semester we will be building web applications using Node.js. You will notice that the amount of reading we have in the first part of the semester is extensive, but this will greatly fascilitate the development of this first project. Technically speaking, your e-commerce app code completely come from your work in the Online Videos Course as long as you make it your own, and integrate it with your other assignments in your node application. It is advised that you integrate your e-commerce app in the node app for this class starting in week 2 to avoid an extensive amount of work to be done in a short period of time later on. All other assignments and team activities should be in this same node app, with routes configured for optimal organization. For help getting these routes configured, please watch the week 2 walkthrough videos as well as the Scalable Routes Architecture video in the videos tab above.</p>
        <h3>Basic Guidelines</h3>
        <p>One of the strengths of Node.js is its ability to expose web services which can then be consumed by client-side AJAX. </p>

        <p>Along these lines, your project will be a full stack Node.js project that uses Web Services for the communication between the client and the server. We will not be using client-side frameworks for this project, but after completing it, you will be very well prepared to use them for future endeavors.</p>

        <h4>Guidelines</h4>
        <p>For this first project, you are to create an e-commerce application. You may choose any type of products to sell, but your project will be evaluated as to how well it:</p>

        <ol>
            <li><p>Presents a professional look and feel</p></li>
            <li><p>Accomplishes a meaningful task / does something interesting</p></li>
            <li><p>Demonstrates understanding of Node.js and Express principles</p></li>
            <li><p>Demonstrates mastery of Client-side and Server-side communication</p></li>
            <li><p>Successfully incorporates MongoDB for the data layer and shows expertise in creating, reading, updating and deleting data in that database from the Node.JS application.</p></li>
        </ol>
