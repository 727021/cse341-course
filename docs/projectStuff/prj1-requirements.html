        <h1>Project 1 Requirements</h1>
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>For the first half of the semester we will be building web applications using Node.js. </p>
        <h3>Basic Guidelines</h3>
        <p>One of the strengths of Node.js is its ability to expose web services which can then be consumed by client-side AJAX. </p>

        <p>Along these lines, your project will be a full stack Node.js project that uses Web Services for the communication between the client and the server. We will not be using client-side frameworks for this project, but after completing it, you will be very well prepared to use them for future endeavors.</p>

        <h4>Guidelines</h4>
        <p>For this first project, you are to create an e-commerce application. You may choose any type of products to sell, but your project will be evaluated as to how well it:</p>

        <ol>
            <li><p>Presents a professional look and feel</p></li>
            <li><p>Accomplishes a meaningful task / does something interesting</p></li>
            <li><p>Demonstrates understanding of Node.js and Express principles</p></li>
            <li><p>Demonstrates mastery of Client-side and Server-side communication</p></li>
            <li><p>Successfully incorporates MongoDB for the data layer and shows expertise in creating, reading, updating and deleting data in that database from the Node.JS application.</p></li>
        </ol>
