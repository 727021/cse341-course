        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>The team activity this week is intended to assist you in planning out your next project, as well as understanding how you should always plan out projects before code is written.</p>
        <h2>Tasks</h2>
        <ol>
           <li><p>After having completed the readings, research examples of risk analysis and mitigation documents as a group. </p></li>
           <li><p>Individually, create a risk analysis assessment document of your projects along with mitigation techniques that will carry you through to the end of the semester.</p></li>
           <li><p>After having completed your document, share it with your team members.</p></li>
           <li><p>Provide constructive feedback. Think of additional risks that your teammate did not include. Brainstorm ways in which those risks could be mitigated or avoided all together.</p></li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Submission</h2>
        <p>With the feedback provided, finalize your risk analysis and mitigation plan and submit it to I-learn.</p>
