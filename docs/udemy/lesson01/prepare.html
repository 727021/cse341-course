        <h3>Getting started with the online course</h3>
        <p>For the first part of this semester we will build on many concepts taught in an online course. This course will effectively act as our textbook for the first several weeks of the semester. You will watch many lessons on your own, do some with your groups, and then do additional coding exercises on your own to both master the material and to prove what you have learned.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p><heading><a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/nodejs-the-complete-guide/" target="_blank">NodeJS - The Complete Guide</a></heading> - Click here to purchase and begin the course.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>For your technical reading this week, you will completed the following sections of the course: </p>
        <ul>   
            <li><p>Section 1: Introduction                                -- 37min    </p></li>
            <li><p>Section 2: Optional: JavaScript - A Quick Refresher    -- 50min    </p></li>
            <li><p>Section 3: Understanding the Basics                    -- 1hr 33min</p></li>
            <li><p>Section 4: Improved Development Workflow and Debugging -- 48min    </p></li>
            <br>
            <li>Total: Roughly 3.8 hours</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For your information, your team activity for the week will be of the assignment at the end of section 3. If you like, you may do part of that section with your team, then complete the assignment.</p>

        <h2>Getting all set up</h2>
        <h3><a id="vsCode">Visual Studio Code</a></h3>
        <p>You may choose to download and install VS Code from <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download" target="_blank">here</a>. You may also watch the following media content that include helpful tips and tricks to help you work efficiently with this program. If you prefer, you may work with another text/code editor or IDE of your choice.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqCgcpAypFQ" target="_blank">Visual Studio Code Tutorial for Beginners - Introduction (By Academind)</a></p></li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="slack">Slack</h3>
        <p>Follow <a href="https://slack.com/downloads" target="_blank">this link</a> to download and install Slack on your computer. Slack will be used for all course communication, discussions, troubleshooting and collaboration. Once you have installed it, please find the link to join our class workspace in I-Learn.</p>

        <h3 id="github">Github</h3>
        <p>GitHub is essentially a big database of source code for people all around the world. You can make your source code public or private and configure many different permissions and settings. Each project has its own repository, or "repo". This repository will be a clone of the one on your local computer. Thus, you will have three copies of your code, 1) on your local computer, 2) at Heroku, and 3) at GitHub.</p>
        <h4>Create a new repository</h4>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Go to <a href="http://github.com" target="_blank">GitHub.com</a> and sign up for a new account if you haven't already. If you already have an account, that is perfect, you can use it here.</p></li>
            <li><p>After creating an account, return to GitHub.com and sign in. In the upper right corner of the screen you should see a "+" icon. Click this and select "New Repository".</p></li>
            <li><p>Choose a name for your repository (likely cs313-php or something similar).</p></li>
            <li><p>Leave the repo public and do not check the box for a readme. Leave .gitignore and license as "none".</p>
                    <div class="tips">
                    <p>Instructor Tip:</p>
                    <p>It's not technically a problem if you add these other files now, but it makes it a little more difficult when you go to push to GitHub for the first time, because you'll have conflicts that you'll have to resolve. So at this point, it's easiest to leave everything blank.</p>
                </div>
            </li>
            <li><p>Click the button to create the repository.</p></li>
            <li><p>On the page that follows, you should see a URL for your new repository (e.g., "https://github.com/username/repositoryname.git"). Copy this URL for use later on.</p></li>
        </ol>

        <h3 id="node">Node.js</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Open the official page for <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/" target="_blank">Node.js downloads</a> and download Node.js for your operating system.</p></li>
            <li><p>Run the downloaded Node.js Installer - including accepting the license, selecting the destination, and authenticating for the install. <i>This requires Administrator privileges, and you may need to authenticate.</i></p></li>
            <li><p>To ensure Node.js has been installed, run node -v in your terminal - you should get something like v6.9.5</p></li>
            <li><p>Update your version of npm with npm install npm --global. <i>This requires Administrator privileges, and you may need to authenticate</i></p></li>
            <li><p>Congratulations - you've now got Node.js installed, and are ready to start building!</p></li>
        </ol>

        <h3 id="heroku">Heroku</h3>
        <ol>
            <h4>Create a Cloud Account</h4>
            <li><p>Go to <a href="http://heroku.com" target="_blank">Heroku</a> and click the "Sign up" link.      </p></li>
            <li><p>Provide the request information and click on the "Create Free Account" button.                  </p></li>
            <li><p>Respond to the email that you will sent to confirm your email address and activate your account.</p></li>
            <li><p>You are now the proud owner of a cloud platform account!</p></li>
        </ol>
